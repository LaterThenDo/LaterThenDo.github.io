        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Back in May 1882, Jigoro Kano took 
            inspiration from traditional combat techniques
            and developed a new system that aimed to train 
            not just the body, but also the mind and character. 
            He called it judo.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first, judo was mainly seen as a way to defend 
            oneself. But over time, people began to realise its 
            true value, not just as a martial art, but also as a 
            powerful tool for physical and personal development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Judo reached a global stage when it became an Olympic 
            sport during the 1964 Tokyo Games. Today, the 
            International Judo Federation (IJF) includes over 200 
            national federations and five continental unions.

                        Osoto Gari is one of the most fundamental 
                        and powerful throws in judo. The name 
                        means "major outer reap" in Japanese. In 
                        this technique, the attacker (tori) steps 
                        beside their opponent (uke), usually pulling 
                        them slightly off balance toward the back. 
                        Then, the tori uses their to sweep the uke's 
                        leg from the outside while driving them 
                        backward to the ground. It is a clean, effective 
                        move that relies on timing, balance, and control, 
                        and is often one of the first throws beginners 
                        learn in judo.

                        Ouchi Gari, which means "major inner reap" in Japanese, 
                        is a classic judo throw that targets the opponent's inner 
                        leg. In this technique, the attacker (tori) steps in close 
                        to the opponent (uke), usually pulling them slightly forward 
                        and to the side to break their balance. Then, the tori uses 
                        their own leg to sweep the uke's leg from the inside while 
                        pushing them backward, causing them to fall. It's a smooth 
                        and effective move, often used in combination with other 
                        throws to catch the opponent off guard.

                        Ippon Seoi Nage, which means 
                        "one-arm shoulder throw" in 
                        Japanese, is a fast and dynamic 
                        judo technique where the attacker 
                        (tori) throws the opponent (uke) 
                        over their shoulder. To execute it, 
                        the tori grips one of the uke's 
                        arms, turns in closely, and drops 
                        their body low while pulling the 
                        arm over their shoulder. With a 
                        strong lift and twist, the uke is 
                        flipped over and lands on their 
                        back. This throw is popular for 
                        its speed and impact, and when 
                        done cleanly, it can score an 
                        immediate ippon (full point) in 
                        a judo match.

                        Harai Goshi, which means 
                        "sweeping hip throw" in Japanese, 
                        is a powerful judo technique where 
                        the attacker (tori) uses their hip 
                        and leg to throw the opponent (uke) 
                        to the ground. The tori first pulls 
                        the uke forward to break their 
                        balance, then turns their body 
                        and places their hip across the 
                        uke's waist. At the same time, the 
                        tori sweeps the uke's leg upward 
                        and outward with their own leg, 
                        using the hip as a pivot point to 
                        flip the uke over. It is a strong 
                        and graceful throw, often used by 
                        more experienced judokas for its 
                        effectiveness and fluid motion.

        <h3>Randori (Sparring)</h3>
        <p>
            Randori in judo is a form of free practice 
            where two judokas spar in a controlled and 
            respectful manner to apply techniques in a 
            realistic setting. Unlike in formal matches, randori 
            allows both players to move freely and attempt 
            throws, holds, or submissions without a set 
            outcome. The goal isn't to win, but to improve 
            timing, balance, and technique under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are different intensities and focuses in 
            randori, sometimes it is more technical to refine form, 
            while sometimes it is more 
            competitive to help judokas
            test their techniques under pressure.
            Through regular randori, judokas learn to adapt to 
            different opponents, react instinctively, and apply 
            techniques more effectively in real situations.
        </p>

                                Tachi-waza randori focuses on grappling while
                                both judoka are standing up on their feet. The goal
                                is to simply control your opponent, break their balance,
                                and execute clean throws and counters.

                                Ne-waza Randori on the other hand is grappling while
                                both judoka are on the ground. Ne-waza Randori includes
                                pins, chokes, and joint locks, depending on the
                                rank and rules. It trains one's pressure and control,
                                escapes from pins or chokes, and transitions from pins
                                to submissions.

                                        every randori session.

        <h3>Competition</h3>
        <p>
            Judo competitions are matches where two judokas 
            try and throw, pin, or submit each other to 
            score points and win. The goal is to use 
            controlled techniques to either score 1 full point (ippon),
            or by holding the opponent down for a 
            certain amount of time. If no ippon is scored, the judoka 
            with the most points at the end wins.
        </p>
        <p>
            Matches are divided by weight and age categories 
            to keep things fair. There are also time limits, 
            which is usually 4 minutes. If the score is tied when time runs 
            out, the match goes into golden score, a sudden death 
            overtime where the first person to score wins. Judo 
            competitions are not just about strength, they test 
            balance, timing, technique, and strategy, all while 
            following strict rules that promote safety, respect, 
            and fair play.
